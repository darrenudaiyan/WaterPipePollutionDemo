Water Pollution Problem: 

A reservoir has changed its source to a local river, however the river has been polluted from the local chemical factory. The pipe from the reservoir now leech lead and other toxins caused by the contaminated water. So we need to find the maximum number of contaminated units pipes etc. to work out the worst case cost scenario. 

If a waterunit is connected downstream to another one, then it is possible for the contaminated water to flow between them and thus cause fouling damage. The contaminated water cannot flow upstream. 

The water company can produce (from a legacy system) a list of water units/pipes and a list of other units each one is connected to downstream. The list supplied is a comma-separated (CSV) text file and each line of the list is a: main water unit followed by all the other immediate units it can see downstream.
